Subject: URW++ making original 35 fonts available under LPPL

I am forwarding the message below on behalf of Peter Rosenfeld, Managing
Director of URW++, who has kindly agreed to make the basic 35 PostScript
fonts also available under the LPPL.  At his request, I'll be
disseminating the information throughout the TeX community.

Many thanks to Dr. Rosenfeld!

Many thanks are also due to Karl Berry, TUG President, for his unswerving
support and advice and Bogus\{}aw Jackowski, lead TeX Gyre developer,
for pushing the issue.

Best,
Jerzy

Subject: URW++ original 35 fonts available under LPPL

To whom it may concern,

Many years ago, URW++ Design and Development Inc. released their
Type 1 implementations of the basic 35 PostScript fonts under the
GNU General Public License and the Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public
License.

We now additionally release them under the LaTeX Project Public License
(http://www.latex-project.org/lppl), either version 1 or (at your
option) any later version.

Of course, this additional licensing applies to the original URW++
material, not any subsequent changes and additions made by other
parties.

The original font files are widely available, for instance as part of
the Ghostscript 4.00 release, and therefore we are not releasing any new
font files.  Those interested can replace the license terms in those
original files accordingly.  Responsibility for ensuring that no
material is incorrectly licensed remains with the distributor, as
always.

We hope this additional licensing will make our fonts even more widely
available and usable in the free software community, such as the TeX
Gyre Project.

Sincerely,
Peter Rosenfeld (Managing Director, URW++)
